      I started web development in 2024 at Ghana Communication Technology University thanks to FreeCodecamp.
      Hosting my first project led me to github website,a fantastic free hosting platform.
       My coding journey HTML,CSS,PHP,MySQL and now Javascript - hasn't been easy,but i'm determined.
